    name: "WTWR (What to Wear?)",
    description:
      "WTWR is a web application that helps you to decide what to wear based on the weather of a location, Davison MI. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data and then it displays the weather and the clothes you should wear. The application is also full of States and Effects which allows it to dynamically change based on the weather, location, temperature unit and the loading state.",

      "This project was a great way to learn how to use APIs and how to use the data that they provide. I also used this project to learn React and React routes, which allowed me to create a single web application. This project was also an amazing way to learn about React and how to use it to create a web application. I am hoping to continue my learning of React and APIs by creating a user login system and a database to store the user's data.",

    name: "Pathfinder Character Creator",
    description:
      "This is a character creator for the Pathfinder RPG. It is a program made using the .NET framework and C#. The program allows you to create a character and then save, edit, load and delete character data which is store in an SQL database. This program heavily uses the .NET framework and its built in database management systems.",
    takeAway:
      "I really enjoyed using the .NET framework to create this program. It made many parts of an application development much simpler. I learned a great deal about the .NET framework and how C# interacts with it, along with how the framework uses its built in SQL database features. Overall I think this program was a great way to learn these technologies and how to use them.",

    name: "Portfolio Website",
    description:
      "This is the website you are currently on! It was created using Vite and React. The website acts as a single web application, minamzing the amount of times the page needs to reload. It also was designed with the soul idea of being very clean, good looking and simple for users to navigate. The website also has a small amount of API calls which talk to a PHP file that sends the list of classes I have taken through Mott.",
    takeAway:
      "I learned a huge amount while creating this website. It put a lot of my reading and learning into practice. I really wanted a portfolio page that I could be proud of, which I believe I achieved very well. Using Vite to create the intial file paths and structure was a huge game changer when it comes to React App, making this project take much less time to create.",

    name: "Terraria Tutorial Website",
    description:
      "The website is made to help new players to Terraria learn the basics of the game. It is a website that is made using HTML and CSS. It also uses a borrowed website template which was then modified to fit the needs of the website.",
    takeAway:
      "This was not a super complex project, however, it taught me a great deal about HTML structures and css. Having a good understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS is critical when it comes to web development, especially when trying to create more complicated and nice looking websites. I could not have created more intricate websites without the knowledge that I gained from this project. I also learned how to take a website template and modify it significantly, which helped me read and change other people's code.",
